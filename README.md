# banking-app
Banking Application done in C++ for a project in CS 210 for Southern New Hampshire University

# Summarize the project and what problem was it solving
This assignment was to create a banking application. The task at hand was to display a screen with the following information:
1. Initial Investment Amount
2. Monthly Deposit
3. Annual Interest (Compounded)
4. Number Of Years
5. A Way To See The Data ("Press any key to continue...")

When the user continues, the console should display two static reports. One should show the year-end balances and the year-end interest if no additional monthly deposits are made. The second should show the year-end balances and year-end earned interest based on the monthly deposit value that was input by the user.

The user should be able to test different monthly deposit amounts, interest rates, and lengths of time to see how increases and decreases impact their investment growth.

The code needed to account for the following:
1. Month (based on the "Number of Years" field)
2. Opening Amount
3. Deposited Amount
4. Total
5. Interest (Opening Amount + Deposited Amount) * ((Interest Rate / 100) / 12)
6. Closing Balance

# What did you do particularly well?
I think there were a few things I did particularly well. One of the things were error handling, my code effectively validates user input. I also handled the user interface well by making sure that my console contained all required input elements. I also properly handeled calculations so my balance and earned interest charts were correct. Lastly I practiced industry standard best practices and had a great flow chart and pseudocode.

# Where could you enhance your code? How could these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think that there is always room for improvement. While I think that my code is working functionally, there are always ways to make the code more functional. I'm sure I can break my code down into more objects and functions to implement throughout.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and / or resources are you adding to your support network?
There wasn't anything on this project in particular that stumped me, but I found I needed to pay extra attention while doing calculations. I found it best to do a little bit at a time and test it, then keep building on top of that. Some resources I find useful to add to the toolbelt are stackoverflow, youtube, and documentation.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and / or course work?
This project emphasized all of the object oriented programming that we've learned and combined into one project. It brought everything together. I think that this project was great practice and i will continue to use these skills on every single project I have in the future.

# How did you make this porgram maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by mainintaining industry standard best practices. I tried my best to write clean, efficient code. I use proper white spacing and proper commenting.
